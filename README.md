# VBA Encryption-Decryption Project

This repository contains a VBA project which I have prepared during Spreadsheet Programming course in University. This project is for encryption and decryption using Caesar, Playfair, and Vigenere ciphers. It includes a structured module and six forms for user interaction. The project offers a user-friendly interface and clear code structure for easy encryption and decryption of text data.
